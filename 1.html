  W3C is currently headquartered in Massachusetts, with staff members distributed around the world. Four institutions partner to “host” W3C: MIT (USA), ERCIM (France), Keio University (Japan), and Beihang University (China). We are planning the transition to a USA-based incorporated legal entity, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, as of January 1, 2022, which will continue to work with the distributed staff while consolidating financial and administrative functions. The Web Consortium is accepting proposals for Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services; please consult our RFP.
